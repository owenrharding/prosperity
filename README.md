Prosperity is a 15-day global challenge hosted by IMC Trading. Teams are challenged to combine python skills, strategic insight and analytics to trade on a virtual market lead their island into prosperity.

This was a really fun challenge that, while shortlived, got us out of our comfort zones and really got us thinking about new concepts and how to apply them in an effective way through code.
Unfortuneately we weren't able to finish the challenge as it was chewing into too much of our uni time and we chose to prioritise that instead.

After the first round, we had finished 70th Australia. We were pretty happy with this as we'd coded a somewhat effective mean reversion strategy from something which we had no idea what we were doing.
From there we decided to go a lot harder, and did a lot more research into market trading.
For round two, Zack continued to work on our mean reversion algorithm while I started coding some more modular techniques like linar
